# Vector Operator Overloading in C++

## Overview
This C++ program demonstrates **operator overloading** for 3D vectors.  
It allows users to perform **addition (+)** and **multiplication (*)** on two vectors using a `vector` class.

---

## Features
- Take input for **two 3D vectors** from the user
- Perform **vector addition** (`+`)  
- Perform **vector multiplication** (`*`)  
- Demonstrates **OOP concepts**:
  - Classes & Objects
  - Constructors (Default & Parameterized)
  - Operator Overloading
  - Encapsulation

## Example
Enter Vector I: 2
Enter Vector J: 5
Enter Vector K: 9

Enter Vector I: 5
Enter Vector J: 8
Enter Vector K: 3

1st vector is: 2i 5j 9k
2nd vector is: 5i 8j 3k

The addition of vectors:
7i 13j 12k

The multiplication of vectors:
10i 40j 27k
